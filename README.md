# User Styles

User styles are extra css injected by a browser extension to customize the appearance of certain websites. I use the open source extension [[Stylus]](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/).

I save these styles as {{website-name}}.[user.css](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/UserCSS) because that gives an easy to access local file to sync via cloud. Also it means I can edit the styles in my personal code editor, and eventually if need be I can even break out the css into scss components.
